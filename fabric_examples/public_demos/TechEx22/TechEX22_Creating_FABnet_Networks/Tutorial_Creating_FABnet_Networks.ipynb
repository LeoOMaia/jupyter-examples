    "# Creating FABnet Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary features of FABRIC is its ability to deploy distributed sets of VMs connected with high-performance wide-area networks. FABRIC provides two WAN services at two levels, layer 2 circuits and layer 3 IP connectivity.  Both types of networks use FABRIC’s high-performance network infrastructure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some FABRIC experiments require the lower layer 2 circuits.  These experiments tend to involve users needing to configure routers/switches in the core of the network.  However, many experiments are able to use standard IP (layer 3) services.  These experiments tend to involve connecting applications or data management services across FABRIC’s high-performance wide-area networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks the user through creating and configuring experiments using FABRIC’s FABnetv4 (IPv4) networking services. During this tutorial users will create FABnet networks and configure the subnets, IP addresses, and routes for several common usecases. \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, users will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create FABnet networks\n",
    "- Configure routes on nodes to use FABnet networks with a slice\n",
    "- Configure routes on nodes to use FABnet networks between slices\n",
    "- Selectively configure routes on nodes to allow/prevent communication between specific slices\n",
    "\n",
    "## FABnetv4 and FABnetv6\n",
    "\n",
    "FABRIC provides a pair of layer 3 IP networking services across every FABRIC site.  FABnetv4 (IPv4) and FABnetv6 (IPv6). You can think of these services as pair of private internets that connect  FABRIC sites using its high-performance network links.  Users can create private subnets that can route IP traffic through the shared FABnet networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FABlib API enables FABRIC users to create isolated FABnet networks.  Each FABnet network is issued a subnet of the greater FABnet internets.  Individual VMs can be added to any FABnet networks colocated with he VM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon creation, your individual FABnet network is issued a subnet and gateway by the FABRIC control framework. The user is responsible for configuring the subnet, routes, and IP addresses for their slice and can do so in any way that they wish.  FABRIC is responsible for forwarding traffic between all FABnet networks on behalf of the users.\n",

This example uses components of model `NIC_Basic` which are SR-IOV Virtual Function on a 100 Gpbs Mellanox ConnectX-6 PCI device.  The `get_interfaces` method returns a list of all interfaces associated with the NIC.  Since a `NIC_Basic` has only one interface, you will find only one interface in the list. \n",

    "Next, add a separate `l3network` for each site and pass the list of interfaces on that site that you want to connect to FABnetv4. All interfaces passed to `l3network` must be on the same site and each network will be placed on that site.  By default, a node is put on a random site.  If you want to ensure that your nodes are all on different sites you can specify the name of the sites in the `add_node` methods.  You can use the `fablib.get_random_site()` method to get a set of random site names that guarantee that the sites are different. \n"
